#!/usr/bin/env python3                        shabang line - common practice to show what will execute the command
import urllib.request                         imports - give us access to code that we normally wouldnt have access to
import json
import webbrowser

## Define APOD
apodurl = 'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?'    this is where the picture of the day acutally exists
mykey = 'api_key=DEMO_KEY'                          your NASA developer key (demo key - limit of 5 ip requests per day)

## Call the webservice
apodurlobj = urllib.request.urlopen(apodurl + mykey)  this is a api request and will bring the object from NASA
                                                      to then be used locally (returns file like object)
## read the file-like object
apodread = apodurlobj.read()                         converts it from a file like object then to a JSON object
                                                     

## decode json to python data structure
decodeapod = json.loads(apodread.decode('utf-8'))     we need a python object so we decode this into would would be like
                                                      a python nested dictionary (lists, key pairs)

## display our pythonic data
print("/n/nConverted python data")
print(decodeapod)

## use chrome to open the HTTPS URL
input('\nPress Enter to open NASA Picture of the Day in Chrome')
webbrowser.open(decodeapod['url'])                  access the key named url and return the value
